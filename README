Yoda Client v1.0.0
Author:		Ben Stephens
License:	GPL

Yoda Client is a simplified FTP for checking whether files exist on a hardcoded
FTP host. It provides read access only and does not currently allow
files to be downloaded.  It's intended only for those users who need to see
whether a file exists or not.

Requirements:
*  Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0
*  edtFTPnet/Free - Enterprise Distributed Technologies - Licensed under LGPL

Installation Instructions:
   Simply copy the executable and edtFTPnet.dll to any Directory and run the
   executable.

Possible Improvements:
*  Handle server side disconnections better by automatically reconnecting upon
   user input or providing the user with a connect/disconnect option.
*  Change the path display label to a textbox to allow path changes via 
   keyboard input.

Known Bugs:
*  Once the FTP connection has been lost the program must be restarted to 
   reconnect.
   
Credits:
*  Big thanks to Enterprise Data Technologies for providing eftFTP/Free under
   the LGPL. This project would have been much more than a bit of fun on the
   weekend had there not been such a good API available with a suitable license.
   It simply wouldn't have happened at all.
*  Also thanks to Paul Ingles for posting IconListManager on codeproject.com.
   His example made implementing icons so much easier even though the code did
   require a few changes and optimisation, but with no licensing at all I don't
   think we can complain.
*  And finally the good people at http://dryicons.com for hosting a great range
   of icons. The up arrow icon used in this program came from the Aesthetica
   package using the free license.
   
Notes:
*  Full copies of each of the licenses can be found in the Legal directory.
